### Code.org GameLab
[Robot Face](http://Infinity-Sheep.github.io/RobotFace)
> In this project I used shapes, variables, and randomness to express my creativity and created a Random Robot Face.

> In this project, I used all my knowledge I have learned so far from code.org to create a scene where an audience is cheering on a man singing. In the project, I defined variables, made sprites with animations taken from the internet and code.org, and changed many of their properties using ufnctions like .alpha and .scale
